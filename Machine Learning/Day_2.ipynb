        "Lasso regression and ridge regression are both regularization techniques used in linear regression to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the objective function. The choice between these two regularization methods depends on the specific characteristics of your data and the model you are trying to build.\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Lasso Regression:\n",
        "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) regression adds the L1 norm of the coefficients as a penalty term to the objective function. This penalty term encourages sparsity in the model, meaning it tends to drive some coefficients to exactly zero. Lasso is particularly useful when dealing with datasets that have many features, some of which may be irrelevant or redundant.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to use Lasso:\n",
        "- When you suspect that only a few features are essential for the prediction and want to perform feature selection.\n",
        "- When dealing with high-dimensional data (i.e., datasets with many features).\n",
        "- When you want a simple and interpretable model that only includes the most relevant features.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Ridge Regression:\n",
        "Ridge regression adds the L2 norm of the coefficients as a penalty term to the objective function. The L2 penalty term penalizes large coefficients, effectively shrinking them towards zero without making them exactly zero. Ridge regression is helpful when multicollinearity (high correlation) exists between features, as it can help stabilize the model and reduce the impact of correlated features.\n",
        "\n",
        "When to use Ridge:\n",
        "- When you have collinear features (features that are highly correlated) and want to reduce their impact on the model.\n",
        "- When you don't have prior knowledge about which features are more important, and you want to regularize all features equally.\n",
        "\n",
        "Impact on Underfitting and Overfitting:\n",
        "- Underfitting: Regularization methods like Lasso and Ridge can help reduce underfitting by preventing the model from being too simple and biased. If your model is underfitting the training data (i.e., performs poorly on both training and test data), applying either Lasso or Ridge can improve its performance by adding more flexibility without overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Overfitting: Lasso and Ridge are both effective in preventing overfitting by penalizing large coefficients. However, Lasso's L1 penalty has the advantage of driving some coefficients to exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection, which can be more useful when dealing with high-dimensional datasets. Ridge, on the other hand, reduces the impact of correlated features but does not force any coefficients to be exactly zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, use Lasso when you suspect that only a few features are important, or when dealing with high-dimensional data and you want feature selection. Use Ridge when you have collinear features and want to reduce their impact while still keeping all features in the model. Both methods can help prevent overfitting and underfitting, but the choice depends on the characteristics of your data and the specific goals of your modeling task. Additionally, you can also explore Elastic Net, which combines Lasso and Ridge penalties to provide a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.\n",
        "\n",
        ">>>In summary, Lasso is used when we want to keep things simple and select only the most important features, while Ridge is used when we have similar features and want to reduce their influence. These techniques help us create models that make better predictions on new data."
